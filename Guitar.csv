This is a more advanced design and is used by modern luthiers over the vintage single truss rod. Thus, a warp in the neck in either direction can be fixed. This extends your guitars life by making it more resilient to climate changes. Guitars without this dual action truss rod need hefty repair jobs to fix neck warps.
A feature normally found only in high-end pro guitars, binding extends your guitar life by protecting the edges of the wood from impact and, particularly where end grain would be exposed to moisture damage.
